## University WP

Welcome to University WP, a custom WordPress project designed for a fictional university. This project includes a custom theme and a signup/login system, as well as different pages and post types. Additionally, the site includes live search functionality, different user roles, and the ability to write and delete notes. To achieve this functionality, the project makes use of the WordPress REST API, as well as custom REST APIs for various CRUD operations.
